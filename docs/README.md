Log Analysis Project

📖 Overview
This project is a log analysis tool designed to help you parse server logs, perform IP traffic analysis, and visualize traffic patterns. The primary objective is to identify the most common IP addresses that interact with the server, and visualize this data using bar charts. This is useful for analyzing web traffic, identifying potentially malicious IP addresses, or monitoring resource usage.

🔑 Features
Log Parsing: Extracts relevant details from each server log entry (IP address, request method, status code, etc.).
IP Traffic Analysis: Identifies and counts how often each IP address appears in the logs.
Data Visualization: Generates bar charts to visualize IP traffic patterns.
Extensibility: The project is designed to be easily extended with more sophisticated analysis features (e.g., traffic by time).
